# designjobs.cv

Design jobs with real links, by the community. Open source and free forever.

🌐 **[designjobs.cv](https://designjobs.cv/jobs)**

## What is this?

A free, open-source job board for **designers** — product design, UX, research, content design, design engineering — at startups across healthcare, AI, fintech, climate, consumer, and more, with special attention to **contract roles**. No recruiter spam, no paid listings, no LinkedIn link rot — every listing points at the company's own ATS and is re-verified continuously.

## Features

- 🔗 **Real links only** — every job links to the company's own ATS/careers page and is audited for dead links
- 🕐 **Freshness signals** — posted dates, stale-listing warnings, dead jobs removed automatically
- 🧭 **Know before you apply** — community-reported interview processes (rounds, timeline, take-home, ghosting) in structured form, not free-text reviews
- 👋 **Who to contact** — a likely recruiter or hiring contact per job, sourced from public profiles
- 🌍 **Community-sourced** — anyone can submit a job or share process details
- 🔓 **Open source** — built in the open, maintained by the community
- 🛡️ **Spam-protected** — Cloudflare Turnstile, server-side rate limiting, honeypot fields, manual review queue
- ⚡ **Fast** — static site with server endpoints, loads instantly
- ♿ **Accessible** — semantic HTML, proper contrast, keyboard navigable
- 🌙 **Dark mode** — automatic based on system preference, with manual toggle
