# designjobs — Healthcare UX Jobs (Full Context)

Design Jobs is a community-sourced healthcare UX jobs board. Open source, verified listings, and free forever. Find design roles where your work actually matters.

## Overview

designjobs (health.designjobs.cv) is a free, open-source job board focused exclusively on UX and product design roles at healthcare and health-tech companies. It is community-built, community-maintained, and has no paywalls, ads, or recruiter spam.

## How It Works

- **Community-sourced**: Anyone can submit job listings via the website or contribute directly on GitHub
- **Verified listings**: Every job is checked with real browser validation against the company's ATS (Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Workday, etc.). If the listing is dead, it gets removed
- **No ghost jobs**: Unlike major job boards, we don't keep stale or expired listings. If it's on the board, it's live
- **Open source**: The entire codebase, job data, and validation scripts are public on GitHub
