## Code of Conduct

Be kind, be respectful, be constructive. This board exists to make job searching less brutal — let's treat each other with the same care.

## How to Contribute

### 🎯 Submit a Job Listing

**Easiest way:** Use the **Submit a Job** button on [designjobs.cv](https://designjobs.cv/jobs). It creates a GitHub issue with the job details for a maintainer to review.

**Via Pull Request:**

1. Fork this repo
2. Add your job to `src/data/jobs.json`
3. Follow the schema below
4. Submit a PR with a clear title (e.g., "Add: Senior Product Designer at Linear")

**Job schema:**

```json
{
  "id": "company-role-kebab-case",
  "title": "Job Title",
  "company": "Company Name",
  "companyUrl": "https://company.com",
  "level": "Entry | Junior | Mid | Senior | Staff | Lead | Principal | Director",
  "locationType": "Remote | Hybrid | On-site",
  "location": "City, State or Country",
  "url": "https://direct-link-to-job-posting.com",
  "postedAt": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "vertical": "Healthcare | AI | Fintech | Climate | Consumer | Enterprise/SaaS | Gov/Civic | Education | Other",
  "employmentType": "Full-time | Contract | Freelance",
  "tags": ["relevant", "tags", "here"]
}
```

**Job listing guidelines:**
- Must be a **design role** (product design, UX design, UX research, content design, design engineering, design ops, etc.)
- Must link to the **company's own ATS or careers page** (no LinkedIn links, no aggregators)
- Must be an **active posting** (no expired listings)
- No recruiter/staffing agency posts — direct company listings only

Full vetting criteria live in [`docs/job-vetting-criteria.md`](docs/job-vetting-criteria.md).

### 📋 Share an Interview Process

Been through a company's interview loop? Use **"Share what I know"** on any job page. It's anonymous and structured — rounds, timeline, take-home, whether you heard back — no free-text reviews, just facts. Reports are filed as GitHub issues labeled `interview-process`, reviewed, and then shown on the job page.
